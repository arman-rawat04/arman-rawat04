# Hey, I'm Arman 👋

I like turning ideas into code and seeing what happens.

Currently a student at IIT Mandi, learning, breaking things, and building them again — mostly around AI, ML, DL and anything that looks interesting.

If it sounds cool, I’ll probably try to make it. 🚀

### 🌱 What I’m up to?
- Exploring AI & machine learning  
- Building small projects and experiments  
- Getting better at writing clean code

### 🧰 I usually work with
Python and C++, with libraries like Langchain, Numpy, OpenCv, Pandas, Pytorch and Tensorflow.
(Always learning more.)
