# Hey there! 👋

I'm Arman, I like turning ideas into code and seeing what happens. 

Currently a student at IIT Mandi, learning, breaking things, and building them again, mostly around AI, machine learning and anything that looks interesting.

In short, if it sounds cool, I'll probably try to build it. 🚀

### 🌱 What I’m up to?
- Exploring AI & machine learning  
- Building small projects and experiments  
- Getting better at writing clean code  

---

### 🧰 I usually work with
Python and C++, with libraries like Langchain, Numpy, OpenCv, Pandas, Pytorch and Tensorflow.
(Always learning more.)
